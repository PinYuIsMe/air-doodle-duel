# Air-Doodle Duel

A low-latency, dual-player air-drawing combat game using OpenCV + MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking and a deep learning model for doodle classification.

## Project Goal

- Real-time, marker-less hand tracking for two players
- Air drawing canvas over live camera feed
- Doodle classification (e.g., Circle, Lightning) to trigger attack/defense mechanics

## Tech Stack (planned)

- Python
- OpenCV (video capture, drawing, UI overlay)
- MediaPipe Hands (real-time hand tracking)
- Deep learning doodle classifier (Quick, Draw! dataset)
